## Quick Start

To get started with the BRO Live Broadcast application, you can run it using Node.js or Docker.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (for local installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (for containerized deployment)

### Running with Node.js

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/broadcast-system.git
   cd broadcast-system
   ```

2. **Setup Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Copy .env.template to .env and edit it if needed
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Running with Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SushilkumarDev/broadcast-system.git
   cd broadcast-system
   ```

2. **Setup Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Copy .env.template to .env and edit it if needed
   cp .env.template .env
   # Copy docker-compose.template.yml to docker-compose.yml and edit it if needed
   cp docker-compose.template.yml docker-compose.yml
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, you can access the application at:

- **Home**: [http://localhost:3016](http://localhost:3016)
- **Broadcaster**: [http://localhost:3016/broadcast?id=123&name=Broadcaster](http://localhost:3016/broadcast?id=123&name=Broadcaster)
- **Viewer**: [http://localhost:3016/viewer?id=123&name=Viewer](http://localhost:3016/viewer?id=123&name=Viewer)

The broadcaster can stream audio, video, or screen to all connected viewers and receive messages from them, while viewers can interact with the broadcaster.
